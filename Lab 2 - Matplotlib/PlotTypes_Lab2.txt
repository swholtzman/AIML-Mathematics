LINE PLOTS
Regarding line plots, it is clear that the unsorted and erratic data does not lend itself to a clear line plot.
Though in many plots, trends may be observed such as exponential reduction or increase over time regarding one feature vs another, a scatterplot would be a much more effective determinant of correlation between features.
It should, too, be noted, that only quantitative features may be used when attempting to chart feature relations using a line plot.
Any attempt to integrate categorical features into the provided data will result data charts which are completely unintelligible, serving no inherent use to us.
It should also be noted that, unless our data is sorted ahead of time, our connected line graph will be unreadable.
Therefore, regarding line graphs, quantitative features would hold the only relevant data for a line graph; however, a line graph is not an appropriate representation of the data when a scatter plot would be far more effective for this data set of discrete values.

BAR PLOTS
In terms of bar plots, we find a similar issue to line plots.
Charting any configuration of the data results in useless visualizations, most of which are completely unintelligible.
When categorical data is plotted on the y-axis and quantitative data is on the x-axis, the graphs are completely useless.
The only time the graphs are somewhat visualizable is when categorical data is plotted on the x-axis, as is the use case of a bar plot.
Symboling shows mild promise when plotted on the x-axis, but this is only when compared to the other, far more erratic bar charts, and likely not usable.
However, back to my original point, bar plots do not lend themselves particularly well to this data set.
If we want to find a more usable visualization of this data, with a similar structure, we will have to attempt a histogram representation.

HISTOGRAMS
After our failure to find a reasonable representation of data using a bar chart, we turn to histograms.
Histograms show more promise as a method for comparison, but still have issues when using quantitative data.
Histograms lend themselves best to comparisons of categorical data when said data is plotted on the x-axis.
We find that when categorical features are mapped across the x-axis, a histogram becomes a reasonable method for visualizing data.
Some interesting observations can be made from the generated histograms:
- Volvos have the lowest symboling rate at -1, being the only car make with negative symboling.
- Chevrolet has the best fuel economy vs jaguar and porsche with the lowest
- Three-cylinder engines have the best fuel economy, while twelve has the worst. The trend shows that the more cylinders an engine has, the worse the fuel economy.
- Jaguar, Mercedes, and Porsche have the largest engine size, while Chevrolet has the smallest.
- Jaguar and Porsche have the highest horsepower, while Chevrolet has the lowest.
- Horsepower increases with more cylinders, as 12 cylinders has the highest horsepower and three-cylinders has the lowest.
- Jaguar, Porsche, and Mercedes have the most expensive cars, while Chevrolet and Dodge have the cheapest.

Given the above observations, we begin to paint a picture of relation between larger engine sizes producing more horsepower, and increasing the price of the vehicle.


SCATTERPLOTS
Scatterplots show the most promise for our data visualization purposes.
Given our data consists of discrete, unsorted values, any trends that may be seen with a line chart, are not visible, as defined in our line chart section.
Using the scatter plots, we can avoid this issue and observe any possible trends between features.
This visualization technique exposes numerous observable trends such as:
- Increase in price of a vehicle with increasing engine size may indicate that a larger engine results in a more expensive vehicle
- Increase in price of a vehicle with increasing curb-weight may indicate heavier vehicles tend to be more expensive
- Exponential decrease in price of a vehicle with an increase in highway-mpg gives an unintuitive observation that better mpg results in a cheaper vehicle
- Linear relationship between city-mpg and highway-mpg with both increasing together
- Exponential decrease in horsepower with an increasing highway-mpg suggests lower horsepower has better fuel economy
- Exponential decrease in engine-size with an increase in highway-mpg suggests smaller (lighter) engines may be more fuel efficient
- Exponential decrease in price with improving city-mpg suggests lower cheaper cars may be more fuel efficient (perhaps horsepower is a better judgement of price?)
- Exponential decrease in horsepower with an increasing city-mpg shows more fuel efficient cars have lower horsepower
- Exponential decrease in engine size with an increasing city-mpg suggests smaller engines are more fuel efficient
- Exponential decrease in curb-weight with increase in city-mpg
- Exponential decrease in highway and city mpg with increase in horsepower suggests stronger vehicles are less fuel efficient
- Linear increase in horsepower with an increase in engine size suggests larger engines are more powerful
- Exponential decrease in city and highway mpg with an increase in engine size suggests larger engines are more fuel efficient
- Logarithmic growth in curb weight vs engine size shows a larger engine typically results in a heavier vehicle
- Exponential increase in price with an increasing curb-weight suggests heavier vehicles are more expensive
- Linear decrease in highway and city mpg with an increase in width and length shows larger cars are less fuel efficient
- Exponential increase in price with an increase in length suggests larger cars are more expensive
- Exponential increase in engine-size with an increase in length/width suggests larger cars have larger engines
- Linear increase in wheel-base with an increase in length/width suggests larger cars have wider wheel bases

It's quite apparent from our data that lighter cars typically have reduced horsepower, but are much more fuel efficient for it.
It can also be observed vehicles with larger engines are heavier, but have much higher horsepower than lighter vehicles
This horsepower decreases fuel economy, but seems to increase the pricing of the vehicle
Loose (but still statistically relevant) relations between width/length and mpg also backs up our previous observation that smaller cars are more fuel efficient
It should, however, be noted that categorical data should not be graphed with a scatter plot.
The scatter plot results of categorical data show bar/histogram-like structures, reinforcing our previous conclusion that these data structures lend themselves well to categorical comparisons.



Given our observations made above, we can quite confidently say that Line Graphs and Bar Graphs are not appropriate visualization techniques for our particular data set.
Using histograms and scatterplots, it becomes increasingly apparent that a larger engine is heavier, produces more horsepower, is less fuel efficient but increases the price of a vehicle.
Smaller engines result in lighter and smaller vehicles, but are also much cheaper.
Given our observations gained from analyzing the visual data from our generations, there is found to be a clear correlation between the size of the vehicle and the price of the vehicle.
With that in mind, we then notice that the size of the vehicle is related to the size of the engine and the power output (horsepower) of that engine.
Increased horsepower is also driven by engine size, and expensive cars have larger engines with higher horsepower.
We can therefore extrapolate the conclusion that larger, more powerful engines tend to result in more expensive cars, meaning larger engine sizes are a driving factor in a cars resale value.
